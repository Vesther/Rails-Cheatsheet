# Rails Cheatsheet (Very much Work in Progress)

### Table of Contents
1. [Rails Components]()
2. [Console commands]()
3. [Folder structure]()

## Rails Components
- **ActiveRecord** - The Rails ORM.
- **ActionCable** - Integrated WebSockets for Rails.
- **ActionMailer** - A framework for sending emails.
- **ActionPack** - Comprised of **ActionController** and **ActionDispatch** this handles processing and responding to web requests.
- **ActionView** - Handles view template lookup and rendering.
- **ActiveJob** - Running code at scheduled times outside of the request-response cycle.
- **ActiveModel** - ActiveRecord functionality extended to other things.
- **ActiveStorage** - (Coming in Rails 5.2) Cloud storage uploads and interfacing made easy, integrated with ActiveRecord.
- **ActiveSupport** - Ruby standard library extensions.

## Console commands
`rails new <name>` - Creates a new Rails application with the given name.

`bundle install`- Installs all dependencies specified in the `Gemfile`. Run this command after adding gems to your `Gemfile`. 

`rails server` - Starts up the Rails development server, by default, your application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This is also available under the alias `rails s`

`rails db:migrate` - Runs any new database migrations available in `/db/migrations`

`rails console` - Launches the Rails console, an interactive shell/REPL in the context of your Rails application. You can use it to test code and interact with the database.

## Directory structure

Note: If you are just starting out, the files and folders in **bold** will most likely be the only ones relevant to you. You can safely ignore the rest for the time being.
